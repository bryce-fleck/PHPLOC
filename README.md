# PHPLOC

`phploc` is a tool for quickly measuring the size and analyzing the structure of a PHP project.

## Installation

### PHP Archive (PHAR)

The easiest way to obtain PHPLOC is to download a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](http://php.net/phar) that has all required dependencies of PHPLOC bundled in a single file:

    wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phploc.phar
    chmod +x phploc.phar
    mv phploc.phar /usr/local/bin/phploc

You can also immediately use the PHAR after you have downloaded it, of course:

    wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phploc.phar
    php phploc.phar

### Composer

Simply add a dependency on `phploc/phploc` to your project's `composer.json` file if you use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage the dependencies of your project. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a development-time dependency on PHPLOC:

    {
        "require-dev": {
            "phploc/phploc": "*"
        }
    }

For a standalone, system-wide installation via Composer, a `composer.json` similar to the one shown below can be used from an arbitary directory:

    {
        "require": {
            "phploc/phploc": "*"
        },
        "config": {
            "bin-dir": "/usr/local/bin/"
        }
    }

### PEAR Installer

The following two commands (which you may have to run as `root`) are all that is required to install PHPLOC using the PEAR Installer:

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/phploc
